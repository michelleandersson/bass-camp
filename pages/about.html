                     Mattias Hanskov Palm is the founder and lead teacher of Helsingborg's Double Bass Camp. Outside of the camp, Mattias works as 
                     Double Bass Principal at Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. He studied in georgia with some dudes to get a degree in bass playing
                     and has studied under such famous bass playser as Mr. X and Persident Y. I have no idea what to write here since I do not know
                     what information Mr. Hanskov wants to be on this page. I figure maybe I can just get a copy of the information he has sent 
                     to different competitions? Maybe? Either way he is super cute!
