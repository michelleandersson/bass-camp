                <p class="main__info__text">
                    Helsingborg Summer Double Bass Class was established in 2020 by Mattias Hanskov Palm in partnership with (Lund) and (Shotaheiti)
                    to provide youth with a place in southern Sweden to gather together, sharpen their double bass playing skills, and build connections. 
                    The class takes place during the summer in Helsingborgs concert house and lasts for 3 days. The days are filled with theory 
                    practice in the mornings and after having luch together, the students spend the afternoon with both individual practice and 
                    group rehersal. During the afternoon of the final day of the class, the students hold a short concert for their friends, family, 
                    and anyone else who would like to come and listen.
